/**
 * Provides classes intended to support the development and debugging
 * of the IIncrementalTin classes and their supporting utilities. In general,
 * these classes perform integration testing rather than unit testing.
 * They can, however, be used as examples that give insights unto how a
 * unit test can be set up.  The design and option specifications
 * for these classes evolved to address problems that typically arose
 * during debugging and troubleshooting efforts.
